1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,920
Question: you're in the supermarket
and you're given a choice

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,040
between a paper
and a plastic shopping bag.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,600
Which one do you pick if you want to do
the right thing by the environment?

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,720
Think about it.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,720
Most people pick the paper bag,
it's biodegradable,

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,240
it's recyclable, it's brown.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,520
And when people think of a plastic bag 

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,880
they have something like this
that comes to mind.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,120
Unfortunately, what's not happening
is images like this coming to mind,

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,240
and that is the ecological destruction

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,520
that happens in the extraction
and production of paper fibre

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,040
in order to make a paper back.
